I'm a junior student from Information Management Department, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to work as a research assistant at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm) under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). In summer 2025, I will work as an undergraduate visiting researcher ([UGVR](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/global-engineering-programs/chinese-undergraduate-visiting-research-program)) at Stanford University, supervised by Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/). My research interest lies broadly in NLP and ML. Recently I am drawn by the development of large language models. A list of topics i am actively thinking about/working on: 
- **Enhancing Knowledge Retrieval in LLMs**: I am deeply engaged in exploring methodologies that can dynamically enhance large language models' ability to retrieve information, akin to human cognition. I believe retrieval is crucial for enabling LLMs to continually learn and adapt to the ever-changing world knowledge.

- **Human-LLM Interaction Dynamics**: Another facet of my research curiosity lies in examining the interfaces between large language models and their human users. I am particularly captivated by the concept of a highly tailored AI assistant capable of evolving in tandem with a user's individual experiences and memories, thereby redefining personalized interaction.

Through these pursuits, I strive to contribute to the forefront of NLP and ML research, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence while drawing insights that bridge the gap between machine and human cognition. My long-term research goal is to build a self-evolving LLM capable of continuous learning and adaptation, ultimately achieving a higher degree of artificial general intelligence.
