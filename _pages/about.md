I am a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Information Management, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to work as a research assistant at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm) under the guidance of Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). In Summer 2025, I joined the Stanford SALT Lab as an undergraduate visiting researcher ([UGVR](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/global-engineering-programs/chinese-undergraduate-visiting-research-program)), advised by Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/). 

I believe adaptivity is essential for AI systems operating in real-world settings. My research explores how such systems can adapt (1) to the tasks they solve, (2) the users they interact with, and (3) the social contexts they operate in.

- **Task Adaptivity**: Enhancing how LLMs retrieve, select, and structure contextual knowledge to solve diverse tasks reliably.
- **User Adaptivity**: Developing interaction mechanisms that allow agents to adapt to users' evolving goals and preferences over long time horizons.
- **Social Adaptivity**: Investigating how social factors shape model decisions to build systems that are socially aware, fair, and unbiased across different demographics.
